#Let them eat APIs

>What's wrong with APIs, you say? Isn't it a good thing that we are opening up closed software to allow customization? That depends on whom they are for and what they allow. I would like to suggest that it is not the panacea that we currently believe -- and that there is a good measure of hubris we need to swallow, especially in the area of Software Defined "Everything".

We programmers represent the best of mankind. We are curious and bold, early adopters and adapters. We share our knowledge gladly  and never stop learning. We take on drastic mental shifts like version control and open source. We are the template for an emerging global superintelligence.

Mark Burgess's latest article tackles the infrastructure of our coding culture. Our recklessness could create a new infrastructure of APIs and Artificial Intelligence that we can't back away from. We know that the things we build get used in unexpected ways, we know the government has a disregard for privacy,  
 

We're doing it again. Building things because we can, not because we should.
We move more carefully when we're wounded. Snowden and the subsequent revelations about our country's disregard toward privacy has tempered us but hasn't caused us to change our course. 

about the dangers of creating APIs in a culture of bravado. We're doing things because we can, not because we should. 
The problems with APIs seem quaint by comparison but they are rooted in the same culture. One where programmers are the machine, data is the enemy and social responsibility doesn't figure in.

Programmers are not themselves villains, and though they keep their heads down, it isn't fair to say that they shirk social responsibility. Even small tech communities have organized groups to bring more women into the tech scene. Getting girls to code. Feminism is championed quite vocally, in ways that would make other industries blush.

Granted there is great inequality and a bro nature to tech, but for such a diaphanous scene as tech, this issue has a surprising singularity of voice. Perhaps because its one of the only ways we can demonstrate social responsibility - even as we go through other people's data and doing whatever we can to sell more. We can't wrap our heads around the problem of what we're doing to the rest of society so we pick our battles. In this case, its bring more people into the machine.

Learning to code is another initiative, some have even presented it as a responsibility to learn to code. But what does this do? Certainly its fun to learn a bit of css and html, to change the color of a header or a font - but how does this help people learn to code? 

The core of code, the kernel and machine languages are buried so deep that they are just concepts for most developers. Those would be the good parts to learn because they change far less often than the shifting climes of front end development. But front-end development is all feedback, the feedback is visual and immediate, not so with the core.

So learning to code is tough and it natural and respected to drift into specialization. There is no way to keep track of all the changes with any degree of accuracy. Programmers often keep their heads down, they are pragmatic, they don't care for the hand-waivey movements - things like ethics that don't have specific actions attached. Its more rewarding to learn about the latest thing you can do with gulp, grunt, rake etc. 

This leads to the culture of awesome and the predicament that Mark Burgess addressed. 
"What transformed western health was not surgery, but pharmaceutical technology. Pharma is the equivalent of policy-based repair from within."
We are performing surgery without policies and exposing guts to the rest of the world.

Its also increasingly difficult, I just go on record to say impossible, to be a generalist in this world. Generalists are not just hand-waivey conceptualists, they can be hard-working indy devs and freelancers. They are people trying to run their own business by offering a service to clients. 

The freelancer is stuck in the past making wordpress sites for clients because they can handle that problem. But client's needs are moving beyond static sites into data. 

Similarly the indy dev can only take on a small problem, an rss reader or email client (which with the culture of awesome they have to brag about how quickly they built it) because there are too many parts to do it on their own.

So is this this just some horrible future we have to contend with? is there another way?

I'd like to suggest a different focus. 

Maybe learning to code is less of a social responsibility than learning how to structure data.

We should be more concerned with what our data means than how to code. We should all data miners. By shifting our focus to how data is structured, we gain a couple of things.

1.Standards emerge more quickly
2.APIs are more understood and visible. Instead of a client requesting a website or app, they request an API.
3.Apps, instead of pulling api and data from massive companies, pull from the people, who have structured the data how they want.

Our machines are getting smarter, there is no stopping that. Next to Artificial Intelligence, APIs look like a line in Flatland. One dimensional, linear and declarative. 

But the inputs that go into the machine will always be the most vital points. Whether that's an api or unstructured data for a drone to sort out, its the inputs that guide the algorithms.

This is why I'm learning data science and machine learning. And you should too.

	* over-engineering
	* magic (quicker feedback) frameworks vs hand-code
	* configuration and new tools
