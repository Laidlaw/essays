#Let them eat APIs

Mark Burgess's latest article tackles the infrastructure of our coding culture. Our recklessness could create a new infrastructure of APIs that we can't back away from but can be easily exploited.

>What's wrong with APIs, you say? Isn't it a good thing that we are opening up closed software to allow customization? That depends on whom they are for and what they allow. I would like to suggest that it is not the panacea that we currently believe -- and that there is a good measure of hubris we need to swallow, especially in the area of Software Defined "Everything".

We programmers represent the best of mankind. We are curious and bold, early adopters and adapters. We share our knowledge gladly  and never stop learning. We take on drastic mental shifts like version control and open source. We are the template for an emerging global superintelligence.

Where does our bravado (and potential hubris) come from? Which came first, the asshole or IT? Are people drawn to development because they have certain traits or is there something in myriad habits of development that brings it out? I'm very interested in how our habits can form our intentional stance.

For instance, programmers have a bad taste for hand-wavy articles (like this one) the same way physicists don't care for philosophy. Philosophy doesn't change proof. Often its the other way around. Science has proven things that we don't understand and can't predict, but we have adapted to it.

Just look at the language we use.

['Low-level'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) is a common phrase among developers that means deep.   But deep for developers means machine language, bash, the kernel. Deep into the strange guts of the machine. That is where the truth is, because truth is in the ones and zeros. 

['High-level'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) means abstract and easy - made for humans, not machines. It has a second connotation of being conceptual, philosophic - what the rest of the world calls deep but what programmers equate to the term 'vaporware.' Big thinking that never ships. 

>Aside: Shipping the ship and the bottle.
>If the ship is the idea and the bottle is the app, you can see how difficult it is to make the ship. It must be a very small ship, a minimum viable ship. Big ships never fit.

In other words we prefer pragmatism, not idealism.

Ethical problems are too big for the bottle. They aren't as interesting to community of coders. We mean well and it's very interesting the sorts of ethical problems we do take on.

Women in tech is a very practical problem. The solution is to bring more people into the tech industry. Everybody should learn to code! Everyone should learn to the think the way we think.

>I'm reminded of Rosie the Riveter and the movement to bring women to the factory because we need more people on the assembly line. Get the sensation of progress while helping us make more money!

Learning to code is another initiative, some have even presented it as a responsibility to learn to code. But what does this do? Certainly its fun to learn a bit of css and html, to change the color of a header or a font - but how does this help people learn to code? 

The core of code, the kernel and machine languages are buried so deep that they are just concepts for most developers. Those would be the good parts to learn because they change far less often than the shifting climes of front end development. But front-end development is all feedback, the feedback is visual and immediate, not so with the core.

So learning to code is tough and it natural and respected to drift into specialization. There is no way to keep track of all the changes with any degree of accuracy. Programmers often keep their heads down, they are pragmatic, they don't care for the hand-waivey movements - things like ethics that don't have specific actions attached. Its more rewarding to learn about the latest thing you can do with gulp, grunt, rake etc. 

This leads to the culture of awesome and the predicament that Mark Burgess addressed. 
"What transformed western health was not surgery, but pharmaceutical technology. Pharma is the equivalent of policy-based repair from within."
We are performing surgery without policies and exposing guts to the rest of the world.

Its also increasingly difficult, I just go on record to say impossible, to be a generalist in this world. Generalists are not just hand-waivey conceptualists, they can be hard-working indy devs and freelancers. They are people trying to run their own business by offering a service to clients. 

The freelancer is stuck in the past making wordpress sites for clients because they can handle that problem. But client's needs are moving beyond static sites into data. 

Similarly the indy dev can only take on a small problem, an rss reader or email client (which with the culture of awesome they have to brag about how quickly they built it) because there are too many parts to do it on their own.

So is this this just some horrible future we have to contend with? is there another way?

I'd like to suggest a different focus. 

Maybe learning to code is less of a social responsibility than learning how to structure data.

We should be more concerned with what our data means than how to code. We should all data miners. By shifting our focus to how data is structured, we gain a couple of things.

1.Standards emerge more quickly
2.APIs are more understood and visible. Instead of a client requesting a website or app, they request an API.
3.Apps, instead of pulling api and data from massive companies, pull from the people, who have structured the data how they want.

Our machines are getting smarter, there is no stopping that. Next to Artificial Intelligence, APIs look like a line in Flatland. One dimensional, linear and declarative. 

But the inputs that go into the machine will always be the most vital points. Whether that's an api or unstructured data for a drone to sort out, its the inputs that guide the algorithms.

This is why I'm learning data science and machine learning. And you should too.

Notes
* mention the problem of over engineering solutions.
* the various complexities of learning to code:
	* over-engineering
	* magic (quicker feedback) frameworks vs hand-code
	* configuration and new tools
* add links
* add images
* Further Resources:
	* Machine Learning
	* Date Science Toolkit (new course just started!)
* Incidentally, Mark Burgess's In Search of Certainty is a fantastic read.
