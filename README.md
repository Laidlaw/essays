#Essays
I keep most of my ideas in Evernote but now that I'm trying to collect these thoughts I can't go anywhere without version control. 
###These ideas are not complete nor do I consider them published. So if ideas are expressed poorly, ignorantly, insensitively - it's not me! It's just a little man in my head trying to scratch its way out.
